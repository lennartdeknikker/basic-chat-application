## Concept
The idea behind this project is that 4 friends can have a chat conversation, but when it starts, they are not aware of who is who. By chatting, they have to find out the right names for the right users in 10 minutes. The person that gets most names right wins.

In playing this game they can find out how well they actually know each other.
